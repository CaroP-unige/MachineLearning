# MachineLearning â€“ Robotics Engineering

This repository contains the material developed as part of the Machine Learning course, an integral component of the Robotics Engineering curriculum.

A comprehensive final report summarizing all laboratory assignments completed throughout the course is also included and can be found within this repository. Each lab is organized in its dedicated branch, and the final report brings together the results and insights from all of them.
